# HI THERE :wave:

I'm Diamond from Nigeria, I'm a Project Manager, Market researcher and analyst, I really enjoy the web3 space and love to work with Defi protocols, NFT projects, crypto exchanges and blockchain innovations. Of course, web2 innovations also :wink: while ensuring simplicity of frameworks, breakdown of complex activities using my Agile management skill, punctuality, team work, high performance and objectives of projects are met to stakeholder satisfaction.
